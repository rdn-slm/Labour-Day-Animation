# Labour-Day-Animation

Fundamental of Computer Graphics - SECV2213

Assignment 1b is an assignment for warming-up and getting familiar with the OpenGL libraries and primitives without getting too concerned with the computational resources taken (but I do worry). In Malaysia, Labour Day is celebrated annually on 1st May.
